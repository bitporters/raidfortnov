# About The Law in Beta 0.1

The legal system is designed to maintain order and protect the rights and well-being of individuals within a society. It establishes a set of rules and regulations that everyone must abide by. Breaking the law can have serious consequences, including imprisonment. It is important to understand and respect the law to ensure a safe and just society.

## Fortnov Island

The Island of Fortnov has been deemed a no-go zone by the federal authorities. Nobody is allowed to be there, and no law can be enforced. It is an extremely dangerous place where individuals have no legal protection. Therefore, it is crucial to avoid the island at all costs.

## Guard Patrol and Response

In order to maintain safety and security in New Fort City and Gankston, there are dedicated guards patrolling various areas. These guards are trained to respond to incidents and ensure the well-being of the citizens. However, it is important to note that their response times may vary depending on the nature and severity of the situation.

## Understanding Crimes and Criminal Behavior

In any society, there are different levels of crimes, ranging from minor offenses to major violations. Committing a major crime instantly labels an individual as a criminal, while repeated minor offenses can also lead to criminal status. Once classified as a criminal, not only will the local guards target you, but other citizens may also view you with suspicion.

### Major Crimes and Jail Time

* Attacking Citizens or Guards - 30 seconds per count
* Eliminating Citizens or Guards - 120 seconds per count
* Robbing the bank - 300 second per count
* Escaping Prison - 600 seconds per count
* Destroying ATM Machines - 60 seconds per count

### Minor Crimes and Jail Time

* Damaging ATM Machines - 30 seconds per count
* Tresspassing at the bank or prison - 5 seconds per count
* Stealing Vehicles - 60 seconds per count
* Stealing items from vendors/the banks - 60 seconds per count

## Getting Arrested

If you are eliminated, you will be sent to the local jail where you must plead your case or pay a fine. Additionally, you have the option of voluntarily reporting to the jail to turn yourself in, which can save you from a lengthy stay in the hospital.

### Pleading Guilty

By pleading guilty, you save the city time and money, and your sentence will be reduced by 25%. This not only benefits the city but also shows your willingness to take responsibility for your actions. Thank you for owning up to your misconduct and contributing to a more efficient and fair legal system.

### Pleading Innocent

If you choose to deny the crimes against you, your case will be reviewed by a judge (in later versions, this will be done by a group of your fellow citizens). If found guilty, you will have to serve the full time. However, if you are found innocent, you will be released and cleared of all charges.

### Pay fine

The city is near bankrupt and will accept fine payments from wealthy citizens.  While less than ideal, tough times call for tough measures.  It's very expensive to pay off your crimes though so don't expect to afford this option.
