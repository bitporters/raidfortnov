# ZTA CLASSIC v1.0.0 Released

ZOMBIE TOWN AHHH! (ZTA) has returned and will now be referred to as ZTA CLASSIC.  ZTA was renamed and turned into DEAD SOME DAY (DSD) in 2018 and I've since realized that was a mistake and have restored the previous version as a new project.  

I would like to appologize to the players who enjoyed this game - this was a learning experience for me.

Dead Some Day (DSD) will continue on as a seperate project.  It will start to become a PC only title and take advanced of more advanced graphics/lighting.

ZTA CLASSIC was in closed beta for a week and now moved into open testing.

## Change Log

* The version released is the old v2.7.5 updated to Unreal 5.3.1 - see [2.7.5 changelog](/ztaclassic.github.io/2-7-5-released).

### Removed
* The onlne/mutliplayer system will be migrated to EOS (Epic Online Services) Soon.  
* Ads/Support/Pro has been removed.  ZTA CLASSIC will be a free product and support will be optional.
